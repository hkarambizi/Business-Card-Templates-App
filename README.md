FULL STACK CRUD APP exercise


HW Questions about going from Server Side App to Full Stack App:

1. I am unsure of how to set up my server. (i.e. are we using sessions? .env?) As I go through and look through our last project, I don't see how I am to connect our client side code. Can we discuss this?

2. Do we need Auth Helpers if we are validating on the front end?

3. How's your day going?

4. Without taking up too much of your time, can we go over some of what our npm packages like 'logger', 'pryjs' are doing? Also do we include the new packages we have been using in our server.js?: 'html-loader', 'babel', 'glob'.

Thanks!
